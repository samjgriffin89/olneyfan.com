				<h3>IIS Manager Error</h3>
				
				<h4>The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.</h4>

		<p>Hey again. I ran into an issue tonight when I was setting up a new site. I had set up my hosts file entry and was adding my site to IIS 7 when I ran into this error when trying to start my site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070020)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was very confused at first. I tried to close out processes involving the site (really just Visual Studio) with the task manager, but that did not do anything. So After testing out a few different ideas in IIS, I found the solution. The issue was the default port for the site binding was set to 80. The site I setup was conflicting with an application that was already using that port. To solve the issue, I changed the port to 8080 on the binding. Tried starting my site again and it worked.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
