When I was trying to create my requirements.txt file for my application in PowerShell, I first ran "pip freeze > requirements.txt". However, when I tried to commit to Heroku, I received this error:

![Pip Error](/images/blog/pip-error.png "Pip Error")

This happens because PowerShell outputs UTF-16 by default. Another way to fix it is by using the out-file command with an ascii encoding specified:

{% highlight bash %}
pip freeze | out-file -enc ascii requirements.txt
{% endhighlight %}

This makes it work with PowerShell, or the alternative is to just use the plain old command prompt.
